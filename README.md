# KC1KCE Radio Code Plugs 
This is a collection of programming files for a variety of radios. Most of them are handy-talkies (HTs). The files are named using the manufacturer name, then the radio name separated by an underscore: Manufacturer_Radio or Radioddity_DB25D. The file extensions vary because different programs are used to program different radios. 
Feel free to copy these as needed or use them as a basis for your own radio programming. Nothing in here is in any way copyrighted or private.

## Explanation
For as many radios as I remember to do this, I always save a separate code plug from the factory and label it as such. Sure, I know, source control, why not simply make that the first commit and make a commit message to mark it as such. That would have been a great idea if I didn't start doing this elsewhere. Now, it's a habit. Same with creating experimental code plugs.
